# Elevator Simulation System

This project is a simulation of an elevator system built using React. It demonstrates the functionality of multiple elevators operating across different floors.

## Features

- **Multiple Elevators**: The system consists of three elevators, each capable of moving independently between floors.
- **Up and Down Movement**: Users can trigger the elevators to move either up or down to reach desired floors.
- **Destination Selection**: Users can input their desired destination floor for each elevator.
- **Disabled Input**: Input fields for destination selection are disabled when the elevator is not on the current floor to prevent invalid selections.
- **Realistic Time Simulation**: The time taken to traverse each floor is simulated to be 2 seconds.

## How to Use

1. **Input Floor Number**: Enter the desired floor number in the input field labeled "Floor". The elevator system will consider this as the destination floor for the selected elevator.
2. **Select Elevator**: For each elevator, input the desired destination floor in the respective input field.
3. **Trigger Movement**: Use the arrow buttons (up and down) to trigger the movement of the elevator. Clicking on the up arrow will move the elevator up, and clicking on the down arrow will move it down.
4. **Observing Elevator Position**: The current position of each elevator is displayed on the screen.
